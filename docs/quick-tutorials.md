# Quick Tutorials

## Prerequisites

- **Nimbus suite**: Follow [this](../deployments/nimbus/Readme.md) guide to install complete suite.

## Create a sample deployment

```shell
kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx
```

## Create SecurityIntent and SecurityIntentBinding

### [DNS Manipulation](https://fight.mitre.org/techniques/FGT5006)

Create SecurityIntent and SecurityIntentBinding to prevent DNS Manipulation.

```shell
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: intent.security.nimbus.com/v1alpha1
kind: SecurityIntent
metadata:
  name: dns-manipulation
spec:
  intent:
    id: dnsManipulation
    description: "An adversary can manipulate DNS requests to redirect network traffic and potentially reveal end user activity."
    action: Block
    severity: medium
---
apiVersion: intent.security.nimbus.com/v1alpha1
kind: SecurityIntentBinding
metadata:
  name: dns-manipulation-binding
spec:
  intents:
    - name: dns-manipulation
  selector:
    workloadSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app: nginx
EOF
```

## Verify Resources

* SecurityIntent

```shell
$ kubectl get securityintent
NAME               STATUS    AGE
dns-manipulation   Created   9s
```

Output in `-o wide` for detailed info:

```shell
$ kubectl get securityintent dns-manipulation -o wide
NAME               STATUS    AGE   ID                ACTION
dns-manipulation   Created   17s   dnsManipulation   Block
```

* SecurityIntentBinding

```shell
$ kubectl get securityintentbinding
NAME                       STATUS    AGE   INTENTS   NIMBUSPOLICY
dns-manipulation-binding   Created   69s   1         dns-manipulation-binding
```

* NimbusPolicy

```shell
$ kubectl get nimbuspolicy
NAME                       STATUS    AGE    POLICIES
dns-manipulation-binding   Created   2m9s   2
```

Describe the nimbuspolicy to check which policies are created:

```shell
$ kubectl describe nimbuspolicy dns-manipulation-binding

## Verify the Security Engines policies

Review the policies that are successfully generated as part of `DNSManipulation` SecurityIntent and
SecurityIntentBinding:

### KubeArmorPolicy

```shell
$ kubectl get kubearmorpolicy
NAME                                       AGE
dns-manipulation-binding-dnsmanipulation   5m45s
```

Inspect the policy for detailed info:

```shell
$ kubectl get kubearmorpolicy dns-manipulation-binding-dnsmanipulation -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: security.kubearmor.com/v1
kind: KubeArmorPolicy
metadata:
  annotations:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: nimbus-kubearmor
  creationTimestamp: "2024-07-09T08:03:40Z"
  generation: 1
  name: dns-manipulation-binding-dnsmanipulation
  namespace: default
  ownerReferences:
    - apiVersion: intent.security.nimbus.com/v1alpha1
      blockOwnerDeletion: true
      controller: true
      kind: NimbusPolicy
      name: dns-manipulation-binding
      uid: e942a5dc-397b-4ea5-ae59-54521ca520de
  resourceVersion: "4303"
  uid: 7644a152-ca15-45be-8659-3bd7a28fa40d
spec:
  action: Block
  capabilities: { }
  file:
    matchPaths:
      - path: /etc/resolv.conf
        readOnly: true
  message: An adversary can manipulate DNS requests to redirect network traffic and
    potentially reveal end user activity.
  network: { }
  process: { }
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  syscalls: { }
```

### NetworkPolicy

```shell
$ kubectl get networkpolicy
NAME                                       POD-SELECTOR   AGE
dns-manipulation-binding-dnsmanipulation   app=nginx      6m43s
```

Inspect policy for detailed info:

```shell
$ kubectl get networkpolicy dns-manipulation-binding-dnsmanipulation -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  annotations:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: nimbus-netpol
  creationTimestamp: "2024-07-09T08:03:40Z"
  generation: 1
  name: dns-manipulation-binding-dnsmanipulation
  namespace: default
  ownerReferences:
    - apiVersion: intent.security.nimbus.com/v1alpha1
      blockOwnerDeletion: true
      controller: true
      kind: NimbusPolicy
      name: dns-manipulation-binding
      uid: e942a5dc-397b-4ea5-ae59-54521ca520de
  resourceVersion: "4304"
  uid: 61a3f401-6725-4791-84cc-3ec701e90a62
spec:
  egress:
    - ports:
        - port: 53
          protocol: UDP
        - port: 53
          protocol: TCP
      to:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: kube-system
          podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              k8s-app: kube-dns
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
```

From the `DNSManipulation` SecurityIntent two security policies were generated:

- KubeArmor Policy: This policy prevents modification of the `/etc/resolv.conf` file, ensuring the integrity of DNS
  configuration and preventing potential DNS hijacking.


- Kubernetes Network Policy: This policy allows outbound traffic on UDP and TCP ports 53 only to the
  `kube-dns` pods within the `kube-system` namespace. This restricts access to the DNS server, enhancing security while
  enabling pods to resolve DNS names.

**Enforcement is handled by the relevant security engines. Here, KubeArmor and a NetworkPolicy-enforcing CNI solution.**

## Cleanup

* The SecurityIntent and SecurityIntentBinding created earlier are no longer needed and can be deleted:

```shell
$ kubectl delete securityintent,securityintentbinding --all
securityintent.intent.security.nimbus.com "dns-manipulation" deleted
securityintentbinding.intent.security.nimbus.com "dns-manipulation-binding" deleted
```

* Delete deployment

```shell
$ kubectl delete deploy nginx
deployment.apps "nginx" deleted
```

* Confirm all resources have been deleted (Optional)

```shell
$ kubectl get securityintent,securityintentbinding,nimbuspolicy,kubearmorpolicy,netpol
No resources found
```

## Next steps

- Try out [detailed examples](intents) and review the policy generation.
