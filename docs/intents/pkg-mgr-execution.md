# Objective

**Attack vectors**: Adversaries can exploit third-party software suites used for administration, monitoring,
and deployment within an enterprise network. These suites often rely on package managers for software installation and
updates, which can be a vulnerability.

**Mitigation**: The `Package Manager Execution` `SecurityIntent` aims to mitigate this risk by preventing
unauthorized or potentially harmful package management operations. This is especially critical in a Kubernetes
environment, where attackers can leverage package managers to deploy malicious software or manipulate existing
applications.

> [!NOTE]
> Enforcement is handled by the relevant security engines. In this case, [KubeArmor](https://kubearmor.io/).

## Policies

The `Package Manager Execution` SecurityIntent` generates a security policy to satisfy the
SecurityIntent.

- **KubeArmor Policy**: This policy restricts or prevents package management operations within your
  Kubernetes environment.
