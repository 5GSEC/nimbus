   This test validates that creating a `escapeToHost` SecurityIntent with ClusterSecurityIntentBinding with a matchNames of "*" generates the expected cluster Kyverno Policy, and kubearmor policies in all the namespaces in the cluster except kube-system

        Verify the created SecurityIntentBinding status subresource includes the number and names of

        The number of generated nimbus policies are checked by getting the number of lines in the 
        "kubectl get ns" operation. This number is then reduced by 2 - one line for the header (NAME
        STATUS AGE)  and another line for the kube-system namespace as we do not create Nimbus
        policies in that namespace
